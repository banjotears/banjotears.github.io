Hey, I'm Jake! I'm a narrative designer currently studying Interactive Entertainment at the University of Southern California.<br><br>

Games have always been my absolute favorite art form, and I work to create games that help others recontextualize the way they see the world around them in the way that so many games have done for me.<br><br>

Through my experience in game design and theatre, I have crafted immersive, engaging experiences for players both physically and digitally. <br><br>

I'm always looking for my next major project, whether that's via learning a new tool, a new way of creating something, or engaging with a piece of media to draw inspiration from. If you're interested in me and my skillset, feel free to shoot me an email!
