<p>Gameplay is split between two unique sections, exploring and basebuilding.<br>
During exploration, the player character Maya can fight enemies, collect resources,<br>
and learn more about the world around them. The world of Ch'Kay Goh is dangerous, though, <br>
and each visit has a new layout.</p>

<p>During basebuilding, players could use the resources collected by exploring to build new buildings,<br>
each with their own unique effects during the exploration section.<br>
Some can even introduce new characters to Maya's growing outpost!</p>

<p>Through the 12 week production cycle, I focused on level design, narrative, and audio.<br>
 I was in charge of all of the dialogue and worldbuilding, ensuring it stayed true to the vision of the game.<br>
 I used Yarn Spinner in order to have a functional dialogue system.<br>

<p>Working with audio, I was in charge of meeting with students from the Berklee College of Music<br>
who were tasked with creating our music and sound effects. I met with them once a week to discuss progress,<br>
share inspiration, and give feedback. Once all of our assets were completed, I implemented them into the game,<br>
including a simple system that would randomly play from a set of sound effects to keep the sound effects engaging.</p>
