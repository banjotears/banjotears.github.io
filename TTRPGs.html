<h2>MONSTER OF THE WEEK CAMPAIGN</h2>
<h3>Keeper | Scenario Writer</h3>
<h3>A coming-of-age action-horror campaign inspired by Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gravity Falls, & Stranger Things</h3>
<img src= "Site Files/monster of the week.webp">
<p>Players take on the role of a gang of teenagers in the fictional city of Culver, Washington, as they protect it from various<br>
magical threats based on anything from urban legends to pop music.<br>
Before each session, I would write the mystery, inspired by anything from horror media to songs I couldn't get out of my head.<br>
During every session, I ensure each player was engaged, creating a space for collaborative storytelling surrounding themes of growing up,<br>
queerness, and how identities are formed. By running a new mystery each session, players never know what they are up against, having to rely<br>
on themselves and others to protect victims and defeat whatever dark entity lurks just outside their view.
