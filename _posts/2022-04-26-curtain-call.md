##### A playthrough of Jodie's 3rd date, which I was responsible for writing, editing, and implementing.
### My Responsibilities
* Collaborated with a team of 6 to create a 3-4 hour cozy/comedic visual novel in Unity about vulnerability and self-actualization
* Drafted and implemented 2 long-form "Date" and 3 short-form "Conversation" scenarios for players
* Created upwards of 40 different branching character responses per scenario based on player decisions

### Owned Scenarios
* Billie's final date
* Jodie's 3rd date
* Billie's TTRPG Conversation 
* Jodie's Music Conversation 
* Jodie's Breakup Conversation
### What Sets Curtain Call Apart?
* Choices I wrote radically change the story being told unlike other visual novels
* Scenarios have exclusive dialogue, choices, and full narrative sequences based on player decisions
* Since only one option is available per runthrough of the date, players are incentivized to replay the game and experience every possible interaction.

### My Process
* For dates, I started with the location first
* Afterwards, I would draft the date as a simple outline before beginning to write in Yarn Spinner.

* After my first draft, I iterated based on feedback from my teammates and playtesters. 
* Our goals while designing each scenario were to make the characters feel real and have players feel like their choices have value beyond just numeric outputs.
