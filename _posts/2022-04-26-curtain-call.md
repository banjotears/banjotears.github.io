##### A playthrough of Jodie's 3rd date, which I was responsible for writing, editing, and implementing.
### Collaborated with a team of 6 to create a 3-4 hour cozy/comedic visual novel in Unity about vulnerability and self-actualization
### Drafted and implemented 2 long-form "Date" and 3 short-form "Conversation" scenarios for players
### Created upwards of 40 different branching character responses per scenario based on player decisions

I wrote Billie's final date, Jodie's 3rd date,  a conversation for both characters, and Jodie's "breakup" conversation.
Unlike other visual novels where the choice may affect a line or two, choices I wrote were able to have radically different changes to the story being told.
Each location had exclusive dialogue, choices, and narrative repercussions based on which choice is selected. 
Since only one can be chosen per runthrough of the date, players are incentivized to replay the game and experience every interaction.

For dates, I started with the location first, discussing with my team where a good location to set the date would be. After that, I would draft the date as a simple outline before beginning writing in Yarn Spinner.

After my first draft, I iterated based on feedback from my teammates and playtesters. 
Our goals while designing each scenario were to make the characters feel real and have players feel like their choices have value beyond just numeric outputs.
