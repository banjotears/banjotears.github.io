##### A playthrough of Jodie's 3rd date.
### Collaborated with a team of 6 to create a 3-4 hour cozy/comedic visual novel in Unity about vulnerability and self-actualization
### Drafted and implemented 2 long-form "Date" and 3 short-form "Conversation" scenarios for players, creating up to 40 different branching character responses per scenario based on player decisions

I wrote Billie's final date, Jodie's 3rd date,  a conversation for both characters, and Jodie's "breakup" conversation. When desigining each scenario, I would implement 2 or 3 choices for the player character. However, unlike other visual novels where the choice may affect a line or two or affect an invisible value that would cause the character to deepen their relationship with the player, choices would have radically different changes to the story being told. For example, in Jodie's 3rd Date at the aquarium, players can choose between 3 separate locations within the aquarium to explore. Each location had exclusive dialogue, choices, and narrative repercussions based on which was selected. Since only one could be chosen per runthrough of the date, players were incentivized to replay the game and experience every aspect of each character.

For dates, I started with the location first, discussing with my team where a good location to set the date would be. After that, I would draft the date as a simple outline before beginning writing in Yarn Spinner.

After my first draft, I iterated based on feedback from my teammates and playtesters. This project was a fantastic exercise in the power of strong narrative design, as two of our goals while designing each interaction was making the characters feel real and have players feel like their choices matter and have value beyond just whether they get to truly know and understand each character during their route.
