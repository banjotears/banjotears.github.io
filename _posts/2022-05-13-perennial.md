##### Developed 3 basic randomly generated levels which would shuffle into new layouts for players to explore during each playthrough of game
##### Composed dialogue for main character and 3 NPCs in Yarn Spinner alongside 5 short stories to assist worldbuilding

Gameplay is split between two unique sections, exploring and basebuilding. During exploration, the player character Maya can fight enemies, collect resources, and learn more about the world around them. The world of Ch'Kay Goh is forever shifting though, and each visit has a new layout. While basebuilding, players can use the resources collected by exploring to build new buildings, each with their own unique effects during the exploration section. Some can even introduce new characters to Maya's growing outpost!

Through the 12 week production cycle, I focused on level design, narrative, and audio. I was in charge of all of the dialogue and worldbuilding, ensuring it stayed true to the vision of the game.

I implemented Yarn Spinner for our dialogue system alongside generating all of the dialogue in-game. I created multiple friendly characters able to join the player's outpost as well as several tablets detailing extra elements and stories set in the game's world being interactable by the player. Design-wise, I worked on the game's spatial inventory system, enemy behaviors, audio implementation, and basic combat.

Working with our audio team, I was in charge of meeting with students from the Berklee College of Music who were tasked with creating our music and sound effects. I met with them once a week to discuss progress, share inspiration, and give feedback. Once all of our assets were completed, I implemented them into the game, including a simple system that would randomly play from a set of sound effects to keep the sound effects diverse and engaging.

This project was a major learning experience, particularly when it comes to player behavior and explaining mechanics to new players. We sought to have players make difficult decisions regarding resource management and basebuilding vs exploration and combat, but players were much more invested in the exploration side than the basebuilding. It also taught me a lot about the importance of scope, prioritization, and time management when designing experiences.
