## Game Designer 
## One-Page TTRPG 
### Take on the role of farmers in 17th century Germany as they try to outsmart the Devil.

A simple, one-page TTRPG meant to be able to be picked up and played for a short session with very little preparation. Inspired by the Grimm Fairy Tale "The Peasant and the Devil," the game focuses on clever wordplay, making deals, and the Players/GM attempting to outsmart the other. 

The system relies on a single d6, with the two stats being focused on sowing (beginning actions) and reaping (ending actions). As these are very open-ended, the system rewards players who think outside of the box in regards to using their better stat. 

While designing this game with my team, I wanted to focus on two broad verbs similar to another One-Page RPG: Lasers and Feelings. By broadening the verbs to essentially be in charge of either beginning a task or ending it, it allows players to get creative in how they solve problems. Given the original fairy tale is all about a group of peasants outsmarting the Devil, I aimed to make the experience of play require at least some creativity while figuring out potential solutions much like the characters this RPG was inspired by.
