A simple, one-page TTRPG meant to be able to be picked up and played for a short session with very little preparation. The game is driven byclever wordplay, making deals, and the Players/GM attempting to outsmart each other. 

The system relies on a single d6, with the two stats being focused on sowing (beginning actions) and reaping (ending actions). Intentionally open-ended, the system rewards players who are creative in convincing the GM to let them use their better stat. 

While designing this game with my team, I wanted to focus on two broad verbs similar to another One-Page RPG: Lasers and Feelings.
By broadening the verbs while staying thematic via Sow and Reap, it allows players to get creative in how they solve problems. Given it was inspired by the Grimm Fairy Tale "The Peasant and the Devil", I aimed to make the experience of play require at least some creativity wile figuring out potential solutions much like the characters this RPG was inspired by.
