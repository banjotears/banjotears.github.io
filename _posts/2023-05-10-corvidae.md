CORVIDAE is a first-person adventure stealth game inspired by speculative fiction, abandoned structures, and real-life studies of corvid consciousness. Play as a human anthropologist named Aria, who is sent 50,000 years in the future to a strange world created out of the ruins of various time periods. But Aria is not alone: This new world is populated by giant mysterious creatures evolved from crows and magpies. While exploring, Aria studies the Crowfolk, slowly piecing together their culture, history, and her place in the world. But studying may not be enough: She may have to become more like the Crowfolk in order to survive.

CORVIDAE was a long-form directing exercise for USC's Directing for Video Games class (CTIN 480). While the game hasn't been developed in any capacity, I worked to create a large amount of documentation about the game, including location scouting, prior art exploration, visual references, and screenplays for sample cutscenes.
