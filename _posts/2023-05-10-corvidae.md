## Game Concept
### A biology grad student is mysteriously transported to a world full of anthropomorphic crows, observing and interacting with them in order to find a way back home

* A first-person adventure stealth game inspired by speculative fiction, abandoned structures, and real-life studies of corvid consciousness
*  Play as a human anthropologist named Aria, who is sent 50,000 years in the future to a strange world created out of the ruins of various time periods
*  You are not alone: This new world is populated by giant mysterious creatures evolved from crows and magpies
*  As you explore, you study the Crowfolk, slowly piecing together their culture, history, and Aria's place in the world
*  However, studying may not be enough: She may have to become more like the Crowfolk in order to survive

* CORVIDAE was a long-form directing exercise for USC's Directing for Video Games class (CTIN 480).
*  I worked to create a large amount of documentation about the game, including location scouting, prior art exploration, visual references, and screenplays for sample cutscenes
