A high energy action platformer developed for the USC Games Advanced Game Project. A dark satire of the "plight of the solo dev," players slowly unpack the frustrations of a game designer with killer masterpiece syndrome.<br>

As lead narrative designer, I kept the narrative team on track, ensuring the game's tone and style matched the director's vision. With my prior experience as a game designer, I kept a designer's eye towards the structure of our narrative. We wanted the gameplay to be frenetic and high-energy while still telling a compelling story of a creator and her creation, so I frequently tested the build, keeping track of how often dialogue played, when we had space for the player to focus more on the gameplay, and when we could comfortably combine the two modes of engaging with the experience.<br>

Alongside leading the narrative team, I kept and updated a document for all scripted dialogue. Other team members added to/edited the script, but the director, Adam Morina, and I had final say on what was included in the current script. Near the end of production, I worked closely with the audio lead and director in our VO Recording sessions, helping give feedback and direction on the delivery of each line ingame. In-engine, I worked with engineering to add subtitles to our game, with our Lead Engineer even adding Chinese subtitles to the game, expanding our audience overseas.<br>
