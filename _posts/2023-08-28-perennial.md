Gameplay is split between two unique sections, exploring and basebuilding. During exploration, the player character Maya can fight enemies, collect resources, and learn more about the world around them. The world of Ch'Kay Goh is forever shifting though, and each visit has a new layout.

While basebuilding, players can use the resources collected by exploring to build new buildings, each with their own unique effects during the exploration section. Some can even introduce new characters to Maya's growing outpost!

Through the 12 week production cycle, I focused on level design, narrative, and audio. I was in charge of all of the dialogue and worldbuilding, ensuring it stayed true to the vision of the game. I used Yarn Spinner in order to have a functional dialogue system.

Working with audio, I was in charge of meeting with students from the Berklee College of Music who were tasked with creating our music and sound effects. I met with them once a week to discuss progress, share inspiration, and give feedback. Once all of our assets were completed, I implemented them into the game, including a simple system that would randomly play from a set of sound effects to keep the sound effects engaging.
