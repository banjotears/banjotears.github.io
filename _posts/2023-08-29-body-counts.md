## MONSTER OF THE WEEK CAMPAIGN
### Keeper | Scenario Writer
##### A group of teenagers in a small Washington town fight high school life, angst, and supernatural events in this story inspired by Gravity Falls, Stranger Things, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Players take on the role of a gang of teenagers in the fictional town of Culver, Washington, as they protect it from various magical threats based on anything from urban legends to pop music. 

Before each session, I would write the mystery, which includes locations, monsters, minions, NPCs, and potential consequences for players during playtime.
During every session, I ensure that I am creating a space for collaborative storytelling surrounding themes of growing up, queerness, and the vulnerability of youth.
By running a new mystery each session, players always face the unknown and have to rely on themselves and others to protect victims and 
defeat whatever dark entity lurks just outside their view.

Unlike other TTRPG systems, Monster of the Week actively seeks for players to create homebrew content, including mysteries, NPCs, monsters, locations, and minions. It allows for much more player collaboration, permitting the game to become a shared world that can be actively built out and changed by everyone at the table. This campaign has caused me to deepen my skills as a TTRPG designer as I build out stories, lay clues, improvise solutions, and try to get each story resolved within a single 4-hour session.<br>
