Players take on the role of a gang of teenagers in the fictional city of Culver, Washington, as they protect it from various magical threats based on anything from urban legends to pop music. 

Before each session, I would write the mystery, inspired by anything from urban legends and ghost stories to songs I couldn't get out of my head. During every session,
I ensure each player is engaged, creating a space for collaborative storytelling surrounding themes of growing up, queerness, and the vulnerability of youth.
By running a new mystery each session, players never know what they are up against, having to rely on themselves and others to protect victims and 
defeat whatever dark entity lurked just outside their view.
