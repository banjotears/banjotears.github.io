## A collection of prototypes made for USC's Game Prototyping class.
On each of these projects, I collaborated with one other designer in the class. Primarily relying on 2D, representational geometry, we were tasked with creating experimental, engaging games on a weekly basis.
### RocketCrash - Gamefeel

##### An interactable physics toy version of Asteroids where the player can crash into and destroy asteroids if they are moving fast enough.

### Cranetastrophe - Theme

##### A construction-style building puzzle game that asks the question: "What if construction cranes were as reliable as arcade cranes?"

### Ghostlight - Control

##### A one-button dexterity-style arcade game where you play as a magic flashlight trying to get rid of ghosts while avoiding hitting any humans nearby. 

### CashOut - Balance/Feedback Loops

##### An endless runner fused with push your luck mechanics, where each coin increases your potential score when you reach a bank, but also reduces your jump height.

As this class is ongoing, more prototypes will be added during the course of the semester.
