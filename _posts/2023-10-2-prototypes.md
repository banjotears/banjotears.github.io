## A collection of prototypes made for USC's Game Prototyping class.
On each of these projects, I collaborated with one other designer in the class. Primarily relying on 2D, representational geometry, we were tasked with creating experimental, engaging games on a weekly basis.
### RocketCrash - Gamefeel

##### An interactable physics toy version of Asteroids where the player can crash into and destroy asteroids if they are moving fast enough.

### Cranetastrophe - Theme

##### A construction-style building puzzle game that asks the question: "What if construction cranes were as reliable as arcade cranes?"

### Ghostlight - Control
##### A one-button dexterity-style arcade game where you play as a magic flashlight trying to get rid of ghosts while avoiding hitting any humans nearby.

### CashOut - Balance/Feedback Loops

##### An endless runner fused with push your luck mechanics, where each coin increases your potential score when you reach a bank, but also reduces your jump height.

### Depth Reflection - Difficulty

##### A mind-bending puzzle game where the player must reflect a laser to activate prisms in each level. The catch? Some elements are in the foreground!

As this class is ongoing, more prototypes will be added during the course of the semester!
