## Narrative Designer
## (Adventure/Puzzle Game, PC, Unreal Engine)
### You're pulled into an occult conspiracy in Cairo surrounding the summoning of a mysterious being called an "Egregore." Using your ability to shift reality based on connecting information together, you find yourself falling deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole about the very nature of reality itself.
### USC Games MFA Thesis/Advanced Games Project
### Game is currently in development, slated for release this May.

### Responsibilities
* Outline and finalize narrative for all 3 major acts of game: Tutorial, Cafe Ramses, and Sanctum
* Generate documentation for entire team, including style guides, story beats, narrative outlines, and character sheets
* Establish unique dialogue for 50+ node combinatorics available at any time to players
* Implement and finalize dialogue interactions with an emphasis on culture, surrealism, and information flow
* Update narrative in-game weekly based on team and playtest feedback
* Conduct weekly narrative meetings alongside other Narrative Designers and the Director
* Attend VO Sessions to assist VO Director and give additional narrative context to dialogue
### My Process
Our gameplay is driven by graph combinatorics, so I draft each combo generated by the Design team in a spreadsheet, only using 2-3 sentences to describe each interaction.

<div class="dimmed-background" id="dimmed-background1">
  <a href="#" class="close-button">Close</a>

</div>
##### A snippet of the Graph Combo spreadsheet, color-coded to represent what is currently in-engine versus what needs drafting/editing.
##### Green = Implemented | Red = Not Implemented | Orange = Partially Implemented/In Progress
* I expand each interaction to a full sequence in Unreal Engine after drafts are accepted by director
* Graph/node spreadsheet combinations correlate with requirements to unlock the dialogue nodes in-game

##### The Not Yet graph for the first interaction with Al-Bawab. Each line connecting between nodes represents a potential dialogue option for players.
