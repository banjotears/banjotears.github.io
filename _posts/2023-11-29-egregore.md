#### Establishes unique dialogue for 50+ node combinatorics accessible to players
#### Implements and finalizes dialogue interactions with an emphasis on culture, surrealism, and information flow
#### Resolves problems from playtest feedback regarding information flow, updating narrative flow in game weekly
#### Conducts weekly narrative meetings alongside other Narrative Designers and the Director
_Egregore_ is a first-person adventure game inspired by games like _Myst_ and _The Witness_, with a focus on representing authentic Egyptian culture. Made as a joint USC Games MFA Thesis/Advanced Games Project, it is slated for release next May. 

As the Lead Narrative Designer of _Egregore_, my work includes outlining the general narrative of the game, drafting dialogue, and implementing the dialogue in Unreal Engine. Our gameplay is driven by graph combinatorics, so I draft each combo generated by the Design team in a spreadsheet, only using 2-3 sentences to describe each interaction.

Once it comes time to write out dialogue interactions, I use a tool in Unreal Engine called Not Yet, which connects to scripts made by Design and Engineering. These scripts have functionalities ranging from adding new nodes to the player's graph when certain dialogue states are met to making dialogue options appear/disappear based on the connections the player makes in-game.
