## Narrative Designer
## (Adventure/Puzzle Game, PC, Unreal Engine)

### A joint USC Games MFA Thesis/Advanced Games Project, slated for release next May. 
### Game is currently in development, see our most recent playthrough here!

### Responsibilities:
* Outlines and finalizes narrative for all 3 major acts of game: Tutorial, Cafe Ramses, and Sanctum
* Generates documentation for narrative designers, including narrative style guides, story beats, and character sheets
* Establishes unique dialogue for 50+ node combinatorics accessible to players
* Implements and finalizes dialogue interactions with an emphasis on culture, surrealism, and information flow
* Updates narrative in-game weekly based on team and playtest feedback
* Conducts weekly narrative meetings alongside other Narrative Designers and the Director
### My Process
Our gameplay is driven by graph combinatorics, so I draft each combo generated by the Design team in a spreadsheet, only using 2-3 sentences to describe each interaction.

##### A snippet of the Graph Combo spreadsheet, color-coded to represent what is currently in-engine versus what needs drafting/editing.
##### Green = Implemented | Red = Not Implemented | Orange = Partially Implemented/In Progress
* I expand each interaction to a full sequence in Unreal Engine after drafts are accepted by director
* Graph/node spreadsheet combinations correlate with requirements to unlock the dialogue nodes in-game

##### The Not Yet graph for the first interaction with Al-Bawab. Each line connecting between nodes represents a potential dialogue option for players.
