* I wrote, edited, and finalized all scripted dialogue in screenplay format
* Created over 50 lines of emergent dialogue (Barks)
* While working with the narrative team, the director and I had final say on what was included in the final script
* Helped give feedback and direction to our voice actors during VO recording sessions
* In-engine, I worked to add subtitles that matched the pace of VO as each line played during gameplay
