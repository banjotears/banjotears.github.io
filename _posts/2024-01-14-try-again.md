#### Led narrative team of 3 in finalizing general narrative of game
#### Conducted weekly team meetings alongside director and producers
#### Assigned tasks for all sprints and answered questions from teammates regarding narrative
#### Kept in constant contact with game/level design and audio teams
#### Played through the build alongside project leads, ensuring 90+ lines of dialogue in 15-minute experience didn't overwhelm players

I kept the narrative team on track, ensuring the game's tone and style matched the director's vision, keeping a designer's eye towards the structure of our narrative.<br>
I frequently tested the build, keeping track of dialogue frequency and information flow. <br>

I generated, edited, and finalized all scripted dialogue in screenplay format.<br>
While working with the narrative team, the director and I had final say on what was included in the final script.<br>
Near the end of production, helped give feedback and direction to our voice actors during VO recording sessions.<br>
In-engine, I worked with engineering to add subtitles to our game that matched the pace of lines as they played.<br>
