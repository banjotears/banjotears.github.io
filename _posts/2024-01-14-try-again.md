### Brief Description
* An action platformer developed for the USC Games Advanced Game Project.
* A dark satire of the "plight of the solo dev," players uncover the story of a game designer struggling with masterpiece syndrome
### My Responsibilities
* I wrote, edited, and finalized all scripted dialogue in screenplay format
* Created over 50 lines of emergent dialogue (Barks)
* While working with the narrative team, the director and I had final say on what was included in the final script
* Helped give feedback and direction to our voice actors during VO recording sessions
* In-engine, I worked to add subtitles that matched the pace of VO as each line played during gameplay

### Expanded Responsbilities
* Led narrative team of 3 in finalizing general narrative of game, including cutscenes and scripted gameplay lines
* Conducted weekly team meetings alongside director and producers
* Assigned tasks for all sprints and answered questions from teammates regarding narrative
* Communicated game/level design and audio teams to ensure each discipline was aware of any and all narrative updates
* Tested the build with project leads, ensuring 90+ lines of dialogue in 15-minute experience were properly paced with gameplay
