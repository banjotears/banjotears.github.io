### Brief Description
* An action platformer developed for the USC Games Advanced Game Project.
* A dark satire of the "plight of the solo dev," players uncover the story of a game designer struggling with masterpiece syndrome
### My Responsibilities
* Led narrative team of 3 in finalizing general narrative of game, including cutscenes and scripted gameplay lines
* Conducted weekly team meetings alongside director and producers
* Assigned tasks for all sprints and answered questions from teammates regarding narrative
* Kept in constant contact with game/level design and audio teams
* Played through the build alongside project leads, ensuring 90+ lines of dialogue in 15-minute experience didn't overwhelm players

* I generated, edited, and finalized scripted dialogue in screenplay format
* Created over 50 lines of emergent dialogue (Barks)
* While working with the narrative team, the director and I had final say on what was included in the final script
* Near the end of production, helped give feedback and direction to our voice actors during VO recording sessions
* In-engine, I worked with engineering to add subtitles to our game that matched the pace of lines as they played
