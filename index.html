I'm a narrative designer, TTRPG designer, theatre hobbyist, and stand-up comic currently studying Interactive Entertainment at the University of Southern California.
Games have always been my absolute favorite medium, and I work to create games that help others recontextualize the way they see the world around them in the way that so many games have done for me. 
Through my experience in game design, film, and theatre, I have crafted immersive, engaging physical and digital experiences for various audiences. 
I'm always looking for my next project, whether that's learning a new tool, a new way of articulating ideas, or engaging with a piece of media to draw inspiration from. If you're interested in me and my skillset, feel free to shoot me an email or reach out via LinkedIn!
