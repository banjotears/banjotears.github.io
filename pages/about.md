## Hey, I'm Jake! 

I'm a technical narrative designer currently studying Interactive Entertainment at the University of Southern California.
Games have always been my absolute favorite art form, and I work to create games that help others recontextualize the way they see the world around them in the way that so many games have done for me. 
Through my experience in game design and theatre, I have crafted immersive, engaging physical and digital experiences for players. 
I'm always looking for my next major project, whether that's via learning a new tool, a new way of creating something or engaging with a piece of media to draw inspiration from. If you're interested in me and my skillset, feel free to shoot me an email!
